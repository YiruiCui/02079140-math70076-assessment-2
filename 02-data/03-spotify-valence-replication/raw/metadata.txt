## Purpose of Dataset

This dataset is used for analyzing emotional qualities in music through the `valence` score and associated audio features. Our replication focuses on regression modeling and clustering based on these characteristics to replicate and extend the work in Dutta & Mookherjee (2023).

## Fields and Descriptions

### 1. valence (float)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Description: Musical positivity conveyed by a track. Higher = happier, lower = sad/angry.

### 2. acousticness (float)
- Description: Confidence measure (0.0–1.0) that the track is acoustic.

### 3. danceability (float)
- Description: How suitable the track is for dancing (rhythm, beat strength, tempo).

### 4. energy (float)
- Description: Intensity and activity of the track (0.0–1.0 scale).

### 5. instrumentalness (float)
- Description: Likelihood that the track has no vocals (1.0 = highly instrumental).

### 6. key (integer)
- Description: Estimated key of the track using pitch class notation (0=C, 1=C#, ..., 11=B).

### 7. liveness (float)
- Description: Presence of an audience in the recording. Higher = more likely live performance.

### 8. loudness (float)
- Unit: dB (decibels)
- Description: Overall track loudness. Typically between -60 and 0 dB.

### 9. mode (integer: 0 or 1)
- Description: Modality of the track (0 = minor, 1 = major).

### 10. speechiness (float)
- Description: Presence of spoken words (e.g., rap, poetry).

### 11. tempo (float)

## Dropped / Ignored Columns
- **track.id, name, artist, popularity, explicit**: Metadata not used in modeling or analysis.
- **release_date**: Redundant with `year`.
- **duration_ms**: Not used in this study.

## Preprocessing Notes
- Removed duplicate rows and rows with missing values in modeling features.
- Converted `year` to numeric for plotting and regression.
- Converted `mode` and `key` to factor where appropriate.
- Sampled 15,000 observations for analysis to reduce memory load while preserving trends.
